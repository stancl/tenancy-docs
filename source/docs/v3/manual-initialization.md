# Manual initialization {#manual-initialization}

Sometimes you may want to initialize tenancy manually â€” that is, not using web middleware, command traits, queue tenancy etc. A common use case for this is if you need to use `artisan tinker` for a specific tenant.

For that, use the `initialize()` method on `Stancl\Tenancy\Tenancy`. You can resolve the `Tenancy` instance out of the container using the `tenancy()` helper.

```php
$tenant = Tenant::find('some-id');

tenancy()->initialize($tenant);
```
